### Overview:
This repository stores the scripts that are used by the lab in pre-processing and anaysis of raw imagery and UAS data products. Most of the scripts and steps are wrappers and adapted cases of the exisitng functionality from lidR package, CloudCompare, ImageMagick, Exiftool, and Python CV2 module. The main purpose of the repository is to keep the most up-to-date versions of scripts for the lab use. However, at this point there is no particular order in the files and most of the code chunks or script need to be adapted for a specific task.
